# Project 2

- Same groups as for project 1
- Based on your project 1 topic you get 3rd party API. Using HTML, CSS, and JS create a page that uses data from your api
- Documentation
  - `team.md` - list of team members
  - `{student-name}.md` - each team member has to create own .md file and describe how they contributed to this project. Provide as many details as you can as this project will be graded individually
- Create `project-2/` folder in the root of your repo and push all the project files. Each team member has to have files in their repo, otherwise student won't be graded
- Each of the team members opens pull request and submits the link to it via blackboard
